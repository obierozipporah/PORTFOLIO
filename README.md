## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - Form control
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - For form validation
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Emotion Css](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)- For styles

### What I learned

In this coding excercise, I learnt about using various packages, like Formik, to use for form control, and also Yup for validation. I found that using tailwind for styling is very useful and I was able to use keyframes for an animation on the validation error, but it has a limit to what it can do with grid. I found I had to use emotion css to really enhance what I needed to do

### Continued development

I definitely want to use more variables for spacing in css, as I found I was writing a lot of the same spacing values.

### Useful resources

- [Formik tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a94FOvaBomQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiPmFbtzEWjESkqBVDbdgGu) - This helped me get a grasp on how to use formik and is a really indepth resource.
